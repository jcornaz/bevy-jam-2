# Combine vs aliens

My (potential) contribution for the [bevy-jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2)

The theme is "Combine"

## Game idea

You are in the middle of a crop field and drive a combine that needs to harvest as much crop as possible.

But enemies are attacking both the field and the combine.
Conveniently the combine is equipped with a turret that can shoot enemies using the harvested crop as AMMO.

The game is played on a grid of squared cells.
A cell can be harvested at most once.
Cells may also be "harvested" or "destroyed" by enemies.

Difficulty gradually increases over time as there is fewer crop to harvest.
The game ends on player death, showing a score that is the quantity of the harvested crop.

### Controls

* Use WASD or the arrow keys to change the direction of the combine (the combine advances automatically and cannot be stopped)
* Aim with the mouse and shoot with left-click

## MSRV

The minimum supported rust version is, at all times, the latest stable.
